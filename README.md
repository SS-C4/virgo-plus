# Virgo++

## Introduction
This is an implementation of [the paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1247), which build a GKR-based ZKP for unlayered circuit. We test our protocol with SHA circuits. Since the ZK property is derived from a zero-knowledge polynomial commitment, we support [virgo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1482).

## Requirement
- C++14

## Run
``` bash
./run.sh
```
